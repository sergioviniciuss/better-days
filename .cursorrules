# Code Style Rules

- Do NOT add trailing empty lines at the end of files
- Files should end with a single newline character (if any)
- Do NOT add extra whitespace or empty lines unless necessary for readability
- Preserve existing formatting unless explicitly asked to reformat
- When making changes, only modify what's necessary - don't reformat unrelated code

# Database Setup

- Database is hosted on Supabase and is NOT accessible locally
- Do NOT attempt to run `npx prisma migrate dev` or any local Prisma migrations
- When database schema changes are needed:
  1. Update `prisma/schema.prisma` with the new schema
  2. Create a `.sql` migration file (e.g., `add-feature-name.sql`) in the project root
  3. Write the SQL DDL statements that need to be run on Supabase
  4. Instruct the user to run the SQL script in the Supabase SQL Editor
  5. Include comments in the SQL to explain what each statement does
- Always ensure migrations are backward compatible with existing data
- Use DEFAULT values when adding new NOT NULL columns to existing tables
